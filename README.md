# 3DreamEngine Game Engine Project  

This repository aims to develop tools and templates for the [3DreamEngine library](https://github.com/3dreamengine/3DreamEngine), enhancing its accessibility and functionality as a game engine. The main branch currently contains a story-driven game project (which may be moved to a separate branch in the future).  

## **Overview**  
The project consists of three key components: **Tools**, **Modules**, and **Templates**. These components provide developers with resources to streamline the use of 3DreamEngine and facilitate game development.  

---

## **Tools**  
Tools to enhance game state management and resource handling, including:  

- **Game State Manager**: For streamlined state transitions and management.  
- **Dynamic and Modular Resource Loader**: Simplifies asset loading and unloading.  
- **Engine Object**: Facilitates the use of 3DreamEngine with an easy-to-use interface.  
- **Binary Stack Object**: Eases the management of binary stack data structures.  
- **State Management Utilities**: Designed to support the game engine's state management systems.  

---

## **Modules**  
Modules to extend the capabilities of 3DreamEngine, including:  

- **Inventory Manager**: Provides tools for creating and managing inventory systems.  

---

## **Templates**  
Ready-to-use templates to kickstart development, including:  

- **Player Object Templates**: Simplifies player object creation and management.  
- **Game State Templates**: Predefined states, such as `game` and `loading`, for better state organization and implementation.  

---

## **Future Developments**  
The repository is designed to be modular and extensible, making it easier to add new tools, modules, or templates as needed. Contributions and suggestions are welcome to help shape the evolution of the project and its goals.

**Note**: The current story-driven game project in the main branch may be moved to a separate branch to maintain a clean separation between game development and engine development.  (Documentation is coming soon)
